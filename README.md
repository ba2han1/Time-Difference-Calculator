# Time-Difference-Calculator
With this project you can calculate difference beetwen two different time in a short time.  

Epoch time is calculates how many seconds have passed since 1.1.1970 00.00 A.M.

For to be understandable by everyone: It converts given date and time to epoch time.
After that it subtracts two Epoch time with each other. Finally it gives us an difference. (In addition with this code we can see how many hours difference we got.)

I hope you all didn't get bored by my writing.

Have a good day everybody.See you all for other projects and Ä±deas.
